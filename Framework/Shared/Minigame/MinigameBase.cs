/*
Current Plan:

MinigameBase(ComponentBase):
	The base class for the Minigame Razor Component
	Two approaches for passing the data:
		Pass a string of the class which is the MGD for the Minigame, 
		then use reflection to create an instance of the class and use it
		Or create the instance on the Game-Level and pass it to the MG
		-> I would say it doesn't really matter, but the first one hides away
		the data from the Game-Level, which is kinda nice
	The MGB will render in the different elements contained in the MGD
	It also contains an EventCallback for when the Minigame is finished
	This Callback returns a bool, when it's false, nothing happens and the 
	player gets routed to the previous slide, when it's true, the Game 
	executes the actions specified in the json file

MinigameDefBase:
	The base class for the Minigame Definition
	This is the class that will be subclassed by the others to create a minigame
	It contains all the data and logic that is needed for the minigame
	
SvgElement and Subclasses:
	A class that represents an SVG Element
	Contains style and other attributes
	Some subclasses will have additional methods to make changing state a bit easier

Slides.json things:
	I will have to add the possibility to make slides of type Minigame
	They will have actions, that can be executed just like the actions of slide buttons. 
	With this level of polymorphism, I just have to make every property in the 
	JsonClasses nullable and then make my own checks, as there are certain conditions
	to when null is fine and when not, more complicated than the compiler can check.
*/

/*
	Life cycle of a minigame:
	- Minigame gets the string of the class of the MinigameDef
	
	- If MinigameDef is cached in GameState:
	  - Minigame takes the MinigameDef from GameState
	- Else:
	  - Minigame creates an instance of the MinigameDef
	  - MinigameDef is initialized
	  - MinigameDef is added to GameState
	  
	- Minigame subscribes to Finished and Update events of the MinigameDef
	- Minigame supplies the GameState to the MinigameDef
	- *Minigame supplies Mouse and Keyboard services to the MinigameDef
	- Minigame calls the AfterInit method of the MinigameDef
	
	- If specified, the MinigameDef can subscribe to events of the Mouse and Keyboard services
	
	- Minigame renders the MinigameDef
	
	- Minigame listens for the Finished event of the MinigameDef
	- If finished event is triggered, Minig...
